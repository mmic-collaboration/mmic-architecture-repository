    documentation="The AWS/AZ technology architecture outlines how the medicine manufacturing sector integrates equipment sensors to efficiently extract their data, ensuring alignment with quality control, Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), and regulatory compliance. This facilitates real-time monitoring of medicine production processes and realtime data release for predictive monitoring and other operation dashboards.&#xA;&#xA;Digital memberships core team are reshaping the concept of digital medicine manufacturing technology with an edge layer and cloud dashboard. The edge layer orchestrates and revolutionise: &#xA;&#xA;real-time medicine release &#xA;&#xA;Implementation of IoT domain gateway &#xA;&#xA;predictive and reactive dashboard &#xA;&#xA; vast amounts of data streamed in from the plant domain to process domain, edge layer and cloud service provider to meet the key business objectives of the medicine manufacturing. &#xA;&#xA;use of API first based on the business needs and stakeholders' approval &#xA;&#xA;The impact of digitalising the medicine manufacturing process extended far beyond the confines of their LIMS, QMS, and BMS. By adopting lean and efficient enterprise technology architecture will benefits both pharma partners, shareholder and as patients requires a tailored medicines to their unique needs, manufactured with unrivalled efficiency and consistency. &#xA;&#xA;Digital team recommends a cloud agnostic architecture, for easy portability of application across multi-cloud deployment. All of the deployed technology components must conform ISA-95/88 schema. The data payload hierarchy with consistent naming convention to ensure the architecture aggregates the data at Industrial connector level. This shall enable large data sets can be moved around various domains to enable real-time release [ref. section 8 architecture]. "/>
