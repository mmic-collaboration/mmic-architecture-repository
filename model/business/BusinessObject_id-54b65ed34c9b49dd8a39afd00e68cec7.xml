    documentation="A Job Execution Step is a sub-process of a Job, occuring at a particular Station (TBD, 0.4.1), for a particular Product Batch.  It has precise start and end time-stamps.  A Process Event must occur within a single Job execution step.  A Deviation can optionally relate to a Single Job Execution Step.&#xA;&#xA;The Job Execution Step was introduced in v0.4.1 of the PROCESS CDM to bridge the gap between Job Order, Process Events, Batch and Deviation, based on the assumption that a Job Order can span multiple batches.  &#xA;&#xA;Formally, prior to 0.4.1 this gap was filled by &quot;Production Run&quot; which was defined as:&#xA;&#xA; &quot;the single execution of a Recipe that results in a Batch of Product (Type).  It inherits all the properties of a Recipe, including Machine Configuraiton, Production Sequence, Bill of Material, and the People involved in the Production Run.&quot;"/>
