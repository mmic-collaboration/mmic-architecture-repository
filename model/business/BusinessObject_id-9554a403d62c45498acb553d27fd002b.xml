    documentation="The PLANT domain contains data defining the equipment and methods required to manufacture a medicine, the maintenance histories of machines, and raw data generated from them. Data in the PLANT domain is high frequency real-time data (i.e. millisecond latency), not immediately consumable in a business context.  Events are machine readable but not necessarily human readable. The domain aligns with ISA-88 standards on batch control and machine interoperability.&#xA;&#xA;Data in the PLANT domain includes:​&#xA;&#xA; - Objects to support the interoperability of manufacturing and lab equipment used in the production process, and their maintenance histories​.&#xA;&#xA; - The processes and configurations employed by manufacturing and lab equipment to make a medicine​&#xA;&#xA; - Low level telemetry data generated by manufacturing and lab equipment during the production process, including sensor alarms."/>
