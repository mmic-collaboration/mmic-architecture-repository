    documentation="The PROCESS domain contains data to define, configure, execute, document, and certify all stages of a medicines manufacturing process. Via an extension, the PROCESS Domain also captures data to schedule, execute, and record tests carried out in a quality control lab. Data in the PROCESS Domain occur at a lower frequency than those in the PLANT Domain, typically no more than 2-3 second latency, or &quot;near real-time&quot;.  PROCESS Events have direct meaning in a business context, therefore the events are human readable. The domain seeks to be compliant with ISA-95.​&#xA;&#xA;Data in the PROCESS domain include:​&#xA;&#xA; - Work Masters (aka recipes) that dictate how a product will be manufactured, including machine configurations and settings, bills of material, required qualifications of manufacturing operators,&#xA;&#xA; - Schedules, work requests, and job orders that instruct and orchestrate the manufacturing process​,&#xA;&#xA; - Characteristics of the manufactured batch of product, via the batch report,​&#xA;&#xA; - Information regarding lab-based quality control testing, including records for lab job orders, samples, tests, and results, &#xA;&#xA; - Process events that occur during the manufacturing process, which in turn can trigger process control responses, fulfil batch release conditions, and result in deviations.&#xA;&#xA;The assessment of and response to deviations, and their impact on batch release. ​"/>
